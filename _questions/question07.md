### Main Findings
It is possible to notice that brands in the middle of the network are those ones which share the most users with other brands, while instead the ones which are on the edges share the less users with other brands.

***

Concerning New York network, it is visible that brands such as palmangels, sandyliang and eckhaus_latta have their own dynamics and do not share much users with other brands, some other brands instead share lots of users with others, and as a consequence they are placed in the middle of the network, such as proenzashouler.

***

The same behaviour as New York network can be seen in Milan network, in which brands such as filaeurope and philippplein are very far from the center of the network, where there are brands like maxmara, gdcswear and albertaferretti that share almost the same slice of users.
