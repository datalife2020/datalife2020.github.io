number: 8

intro: In order to better understand what was discussed about each brand, we applied Topic Modeling. This lets us see not only the ‘topics’ discussed for each of the brands, but also what the topics themselves have in common between them. In the visualization below, we show the results of the Topic Modeling for each of the most successful brands of both MFW and NYFW. The different ‘clusters’ represent words that are similar and that often appear together in tweets.

### Main Findings
It is interesting to notice how, again, a common factor among almost all the brands is the presence of topics related to the involvement of music artists (see Miley Cyrus and Nicki Minaj for Marc Jacobs) and more in particular of K-Pop artists (Blackpink for prada, Peck Palitchoke for Coach).

Another interesting element resulting from the analysis is the appearance of a topic related to ‘coronavirus’ for Armani (who did its event closed-doors) and Prada, whose event was held on the same day as the beginning of the spread in Italy.
