Gucci made headlines on social media when South Korean pop idol UI stole the show in the front row.

Similarly to Prada and Gucci, Michael Kors’ popularity was also mainly due to the attendance of South Korean celebrity Joy from Red Velvet, who was making its fashion week debut.

Overall, the analysis of the top brands that attracted the most social media attention all share one particular element: the presence of celebrities on the catwalk or in the front rows. The data is sufficiently statistically significant to conclude that it is strategically profitable for brands to invite celebrities to their events to boost their online presence. Despite the fact that most of the attention was directed towards the celebrities, it still contributed to making the brands rise in popularity amongst communities.
